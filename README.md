## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

## Nihon Bango Version

This version was adapted by Megan Quinn for the Front End Nano Degree program. Many aesthetic changes have been made with free wallpapers, fonts, and images found on the web.
